<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Logan Edwards, feel free to call me Logan. I am a freshman and I am majoring in computer science. 
The picture above is me and my two sisters, Kaeleigh on the left and Makenzie on the right. My oldest sister Kaeleigh is a social worker
at a middle school and elementary school. My other sister Makenzie is a film major at the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin.<br>

<h1>Greatest Innovation</h1>
<h2>First working programmable computer, the Z3 (1941) made by Konrad Zuse</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <li>The Z3 was the first programmable computer and fully automatic digital computer. The program code was stored on a punched film.
        The initial values had to be entered manually. This was a major innovation because it was the first step to the computer programming that we know today.</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)#:~:text=The%20Z3%20was%20a%20German,of%20about%205%E2%80%9310%20Hz.">Z3 wikipedia link</a><br></li>
</ul>
<h2>First high-level programming language, FORTRAN (1954) made by John Backus</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <li>FORTRAN was the first high level programming language. FORTRAN was the ideal language for scientific computing and numerical computation.
        The name FORTRAN stands for Formula Translating System. This was innovative because this the first 
        language that led to the creation of the other popular high level languages like Java, Python, and C++.</li>

<h2>Development of GitHub (2008) made by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <li>I think github is one of the most innovative inventions in computing because it was easily allowed programmers to 
        develop and share the code with their team. I started using github in my Object Oriented Programming class
        with Ray Klump (amazing professor by the way). During this class I realized just how useful it is for 
        saving and uploading your code.</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=The%20GitHub%20service%20was%20developed,is%20located%20in%20San%20Francisco.">
